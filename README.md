# DBS Banking System

A desktop-based GUI banking system developed using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **MySQL**, with separate interfaces for **customers** and **admins**. This project simulates core banking operations such as login, balance check, fund transfer, and receipt generation, along with admin functionalities for managing user accounts.

### Key Highlights:
- Built with Pythonâ€™s `tkinter` for the front-end interface.
- Uses an **online MySQL database** for data storage and operations.
- **Customer Module**:
  - Login via account ID or number
  - View balance, profile, and transaction history
  - Transfer funds to other accounts
  - Reset password via registered Gmail
  - Generate and save PDF transaction receipts
  - Send messages to the bank
- **Admin Module**:
  - Login and manage customer records
  - View and respond to customer messages
  - Block/unblock customer accounts

Database credentials are managed in a separate `config.py` file with placeholders to ensure secure and public-friendly uploads.
